# BlackOS
A Linux From Scratch system designed for ARMv8 Systems On a Chip.

# Copyright
Designed and build it by ShyanJMC (Joaquin Manuel Crespo). <br>
The programs under this project are in many licenses (like GPLv2, GPLv3, MIT and others), so if you want the BlackOS's source code see;
* https://github.com/ShyanJMC/LinuxFromScratch-Sources 

# Usage
1. Extract it with "-p" in "tar". Do it in a SDCARD in FAT32 and make it booteable in your partitions tool (fsck, gparted, etc).
2. To boot the Linux system;
> bootm /path/to/zImage

In BlackOS the path is "/boot". 

3. Root's password is empty, so in the login screen ingress as root without password.
